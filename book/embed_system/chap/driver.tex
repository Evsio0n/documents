\chapter{I2C}
Like all bus subsystems, the I2C subsystem is responsible for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Providing an API to implement I2C controller drivers
\item Providing an API to implement I2C device drivers, in kernel space
\item
\item
\end{itemize}

▶
▶ Providing an API to implement I2C device drivers, in user space
▶ The core of the I2C subsystem is located in drivers/i2c/.
▶ The I2C controller drivers are located in drivers/i2c/busses/.
▶ The I2C device drivers are located throughout drivers/, depending on the type
of device (ex: drivers/input/ for input devices).
